# This Perl snippet demonstrates the creation of a new 'person' object named 'fido'
# with the name "Jake". It performs a safety check to ensure that the object was 
# successfully created and dies with an error message if not. Then, it assigns the
# result of the 'hat' function to the 'fido' variable.
my $fido = person->new("Jake");
if (not $fido) { die "Failed to create person object"; }
$fido = hat();
